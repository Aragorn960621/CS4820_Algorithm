Suppose we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with 
costs $(c_e)_{e \in E}$ on the edges and costs
$(c_v)_{v \in V}$ on the vertices.  We wish to
designate a subset of the vertices as \emph{active}
and a subset of the edges as \emph{eligible},
such that every inactive vertex can be joined
to at least one active vertex by a path made up
of eligible edges.  Design an algorithm
to choose the set of active vertices, $A$, and
the set of eligible edges, $F$, so as to 
minimize their combined cost,
$\sum_{v \in A} c_v + \sum_{e \in F} c_e.$

\textbf{Remark:} You may assume that $G$ is a 
connected graph. In particular, if $G$ has $n$
vertices and $m$ edges, you may assume $m \geq n-1$.
