{\bf (2)} {\em (10 = 2+8 points)}
In the {\sc Paired Interval Scheduling} problem one is given sets
$S_1,\ldots,S_n \subset \mathbb{R}$, each of which is a union
of two disjoint closed intervals with distinct integer 
endpoints. In other words, $S_i = [a_i,b_i] \cup [c_i,d_i]$
where $a_i < b_i < c_i < d_i$ are all integers. One is also
given a positive integer $k \le n$. The problem is to decide
whether there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint sets among the 
collection $\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}$. 

{\bf (a)} {\em (2 points)} 
What is wrong with the following incorrect proof that 
{\sc Paired Interval Scheduling} is NP-complete?
\begin{quotation}
\noindent Faced with an instance of the {\sc Paired Interval
Scheduling} problem, we can form a \emph{conflict graph} whose
vertex set is $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, 
with an edge joining $i$ to $j$ if $S_i$ and $S_j$
intersect. The problem asks whether this
graph contains an independent set of size $k$.  The
{\sc Independent Set} problem is NP-Complete, so the
{\sc Paired Interval Scheduling} problem is also NP-Complete.
\end{quotation}

{\bf (b)} {\em (8 points)} Prove that 
{\sc Paired Interval Scheduling} is NP-complete.
