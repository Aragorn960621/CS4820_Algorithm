You've been hired to consult for a local ride sharing service. The
map of Ithaca is divided into a finite set of locations,
$X$, and you have a dataset which reports the
amount of time required to drive 
between any two locations, and the fare
charged for driving a customer between those
two locations. (In other words,
you have matrices $D$ and $F$ such that $D(x,y)$ denotes
the amount of time required to drive from
$x$ to $y$, and $F(x,y)$ denotes the fare to be charged. 
For the purpose of this homework problem,
we will make the unrealistic assumption that
$D(x,y)$ is known {\em precisely}, with no uncertainty.)

Your job is to serve 
requests from people who ask to be picked up at
a specific location $x_i$ at a specific time $t_i$, 
and dropped off at another location $y_i$.  A set of 
requests is \emph{feasible} if it is possible for
a single vehicle to serve all of them.  In other
words, the vehicle can't serve two requests simultaneously, 
and it also needs to have enough time to drive from the 
drop-off point of one request to the pick-up point of 
the next one in order to arrive there at (or before) the 
requested pick-up time.

Given an input consisting of the set $X$, the 
distance matrix $D(x,y)$, and a finite set
of requests $(x_i,y_i,t_i)$, design an efficient
algorithm to compute the \emph{maximum total fare}
that can be charged for serving a feasible subset of
the requests.
