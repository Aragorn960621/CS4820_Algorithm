{ \bf (1)}
Computing a maximum flow in a network is a fairly time-consuming
task, but various related problems have \emph{linear-time} algorithms.
Design linear-time 
algorithms for each of the following
problems in a flow network with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.  Prove
the correctness of your algorithm and prove that its running time 
is $O(m+n)$.  In both problems, you are allowed to assume that
the edge capacities are integers.

{\bf (1a)} {\bf Max-flow detection.} {\em (5 points)}\\
  Given a flow network $G$ and a flow $f$ in $G$,
decide whether $f$ is a maximum flow.
\vskip \gap
{\bf (1b)} {\bf Flow improvement.} {\em (5 points)}\\
  Given a flow network $G$, and a flow $f_0$ in $G$
that is \emph{not} a maximum flow, find another flow $f_1$ such that 
$v(f_1) > v(f_0)$.
