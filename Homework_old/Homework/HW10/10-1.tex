Recall that
an instance of the halting problem is a string of the form 
$x;y$ and the goal is to decide if the Turing machine $M_x$ 
encoded by the string $x$ halts on input $y$.
If $M_x$ halts on $y$, then $x; y$ is a \textsc{yes} instance.
Otherwise, $x; y$ is a \textsc{no} instance. Let us say that 
a Turing machine $M$ \emph{fails to solve} the halting 
problem for instance $x;y$ if it 
never terminates or if it produces the wrong answer, 
i.e., it rejects in case that $x;y$ is a \textsc{yes} instance 
or it accepts in case that $x;y$ is a \textsc{no} instance.

Because the halting problem is undecidable, we know
that for every Turing machine $M$ there exists an 
instance $x;y$ of the halting problem such that $M$
fails to solve $x;y$. Describe an algorithm to find 
such an instance. The input to your algorithm is a
description of a Turing machine $M$. For every such
input, your algorithm should run for a finite number
of steps and output
a halting problem instance $x;y$ such that 
$M$ fails to solve $x;y$.
