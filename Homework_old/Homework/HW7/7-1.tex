{ \bf (1)} {\em (10 points)}
Suppose we are given an $n \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ with
non-negative entries, 
and we are interested in the question of whether it can
be expressed as a sum of two matrices $R, C$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \label{cond1}
The entries of $R$ and $C$ are non-negative.
\item  \label{cond2}
The row sums of $R$ are bounded above by $1$.
\item  \label{cond3}
The column sums of $C$ are bounded above by $1$.
\end{enumerate}
When there exist matrices $R,C$ satisfying these
three constraints, such that $R+C=A$, let us call
the pair $(R,C)$ a \emph{row-plus-column (RPC) decomposition
of $A$.}

Design a polynomial-time algorithm that takes
a non-negative matrix $A$ as input, and outputs either
an RPC decomposition or a set of rows, $S$, and a set
of columns, $T$, such that 
\[
  \sum_{i \in S, j \in T} a_{ij} > |S| + |T|.
\]
(In the latter case it follows easily that
there is no RPC decomposition of $A$, since 
the row set $S$ and column set $T$ identify an 
$|S| \times |T|$ submatrix of $A$ whose entries
sum up to more than $|S|+|T|$, whereas the 
entries in the corresponding submatrices of $R$
and $C$ must have sums bounded above by $|S|$
and $|T|$, respectively.)
